### About decision tables
```
Decision tables are a "precise yet compact" (ref. Wikipedia) way of representing conditional logic, and are well suited to business level rules.

Drools supports managing rules in a spreadsheet format. Supported formats are Excel (XLS), and CSV, which means that a variety of spreadsheet programs (such as Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice.org Calc amongst others) can be utilized.
